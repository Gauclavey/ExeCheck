Optprolauncher.exe is an executable file associated with Optimizer Pro v3.2, a software developed by PC Utilities Software Limited, typically found in the installation path C:\Program Files\Optimizer Pro\. While the file is legitimate and part of the Optimizer Pro application, which is designed to optimize system performance, it has garnered a mixed reputation due to its behavior and the nature of the software it supports. Users often report that Optimizer Pro can be intrusive, with some labeling it as potentially unwanted software (PUP) because it may attempt to install additional programs or display aggressive advertisements. Although optprolauncher.exe itself is not classified as a virus or malware, it can cause issues such as high CPU usage or conflicts with other applications, leading to errors or performance degradation. Therefore, while the file is safe in the sense that it is not inherently harmful, caution is advised when using Optimizer Pro, and users may consider uninstalling it if they experience unwanted behavior or system slowdowns.
